    eNotify is a butchered version of the Flask MiniTwit example application.
    The main modifications being to implement functionality for gntp push
    notifications of messages, and implement external post mechanisms for use
    by scripts and external applciations.  If the language will allow you to do
    an http post, you should be able to post notifications to eNotify.

    External post sample code :
    Bash :
        curl -d "username=rpm_builds&message=An externally posted message." http://10.97.154.41:5000/add_insecure_message

    python :
        from urllib import urlencode
        from urllib2 import urlopen, Request
        params = {  'username' : 'rpm_builds',
                    'message' : 'An externally posted message.'}
        data = urlencode(params)
        req = Request('http://10.97.154.41:5000/add_insecure_message', data)
        response = urlopen(req)
        print "Post response : %s " % response.read()

    ~ What is MiniTwit?

      A SQLite and Flask powered twitter clone

    ~ How do I use it?

      1. edit the configuration in the minitwit.py file or
         export an MINITWIT_SETTINGS environment variable
         pointing to a configuration file.

      2. fire up a python shell and run this:

         >>> from minitwit import init_db; init_db()

      3. now you can run the minitwit.py file with your
         python interpreter and the application will
         greet you on http://localhost:5000/
	
    ~ Is it tested?

      You betcha.  Run the `minitwit_tests.py` file to
      see the tests pass.
